todos:
1. products component should load to products array the returned value from two sources (search / categories) - study rxjs to solve!
2. add token to header (using interceptor ?)
3. forms validation (probably using reactive forms)
4. logged-in-notification (and maybe more components) are doing more than one subscribe - fix to one subscribe onInit as state
5. unsubscribe in all places where we subscribe to state (subjects that never die)
